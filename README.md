## Description
The Squid Store is an e-commerce virtual store front designed to sell costumes from the popular TV series Squid Game. The store is built using a collaborative MERN stack single-page application, combining a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. 

## User_Story
